        Wojtek's comment: Throughout the specs we kept using "sending HEI" and
        "receiving HEI" consistently (not only in the WP4's API specs, but also
        in WP2's data dictionary, and probably many other places). We should
        stick with this decision.

        Kai's comment: I think this naming is unfortunate, as it is easily confused

                I think we should either search for an existing XML standard
                (e.g. based on E.123?), or simply allow any string to be passed
                for the phone number.
                
                Example problems include (but probably are not limited to):
                
                - extension numbers - should we introduce <ext> element?
                
                - dial out codes (probably the easiest way of dealing them is to
                  force server implementers to begin each phone number with a "+"
                  sign):

            Wojtek's comment: Signature date doesn't make much sense here, I
            think. As we have discussed, LAs and other parts (!) of the mobility
            can be signed multiple times, and the "current version" here will
            often NOT be signed yet because it's just a snapshot of the *most
            recent* timeline state (which is not necessarily the *last signed*
            one). I believe signatures must be "special type" of timeline
            entries.

                    Kai's comment: No, the component example has one of each

                    is planned (mandatory) as one LOI, recognized (optional) as another
                    and/or recommended (optional) as a third.
                    Whether this is an adequate modeling of "reality" is another question:
                    Maybe a planned *set* of components should be recognized as a
                    *set* of (possibly other) components and possibly having a

        Kai's comment: There's no timeline because I have no opinion about the
        structure. (My main concern is with the underlying data model and the
        support of it by the format. Different ways of supporting the same data
        structure is a discussion I leave to the XML people.)
        As for the nomination status, that's a good question. I have been thinking
        that acceptance would be signalled by the creation of a LA, but we would
        still need a way to signal rejection. How about a simple mobility-status
        with a few values (in some coding scheme)? :
        - Nominated
        - Pending
        - Accepted
        - Rejected
